# Client template chooser
Showcase templates for clients to choose from

## How To Use:
- Each folder is a seperate website template. Edit each `index.html` for each sample. 
- Add as many samples as you like. Update the `index.html` in the repo root with any additional folders. 
- Launch repo root on GitHub Pages.
    - The picker is the default page and will show the chosen sample in the window.
